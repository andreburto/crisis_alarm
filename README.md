CRISIS ALARM
============

## About

This is the source code I currently use to control (turn off / turn on) my Crisis Alarm from my phone's browser.  The PHP is an ugly hack I put together in an evening to get it running.  I hope to get a proper PHP Spark Core library put together soon.

jQuery is used in the project, but I did not include it in this repository.
